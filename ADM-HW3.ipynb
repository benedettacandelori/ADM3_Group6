However, his ship gets damaged, causing the two to spend years trapped on the barren world, unaware of the salvation that would one day come from an unlikely ally.  Years later on Earth, Gokuu Son and Prince Vegeta—believed to be the last survivors of the Saiyan race—are busy training on a remote island. But their sparring is interrupted when the appearance of their old enemy Frieza drives them to search for the last of the wish-granting Dragon Balls on a frozen continent. Once there, Frieza shows off his new allies: Paragus and the now extremely powerful Broly.

Once there, Frieza shows off his new allies: Paragus and the now extremely powerful Broly.

    "Before starting the search, we give some more details about the actual implementation and the rankings. Once we retrieve all the documents that have at least one word in common with the query (see `union_pointers()` in `custom_search_engine.py` for the actual implementation of the union algorithm), we proceed to calculate the tfidf vector associated with the document in the following way:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$tfidf_{document}(word) = \\alpha * tfidf_{title}(word)+(1-\\alpha) * tfidf_{description}(word)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $tfidf_{title}(word)$ is the tfidf of a word seen as part of the title (and characters, etc..) document and $tfidf_{description}(word)$ is the tfidf of a word seen as part of the description document (where a tfidf is 0 if the word isn't in the document), and $\\alpha$ is a parameter chosen by the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then compute the cosine similarity (here we take into account the norm of the query too, because we want a result smaller than 1) between the query and this new tfidf vector. Having run some trials, we noticed that the similarity gave a lot of priority to documents with brief descriptions (as for these documents the tf comes out higher than for longer documents); the tfidf is better suited to work with large documents (for which the term frequency is more meaningful). To overcome this last problem we renormalize the final similarity with a number that depends on the length of the document; the functional form is an arch of ellipse, we choose the parameters with some trials and errors. You can look at the details in `description_titles_cosine_similarity()` inside `custom_search_engine.py`, here we limit ourselves to a simple plot:"

In order to put an end to the Kyuubi's rampage, the leader of the village, the Fourth Hokage, sacrificed his life and sealed the monstrous beast inside the newborn Naruto.  Now, Naruto is a hyperactive and knuckle-headed ninja still living in Konohagakure. Shunned because of the Kyuubi inside him, Naruto struggles to find his place in the village, while his burning desire to become the Hokage of Konohagakure leads him not only to some great new friends, but also some deadly foes.

    "We used the get_data function to get IMDB Reviews Dataset that contains 25,000 movie reviews for training and 25,000 for testing. All these 50,000 reviews are labeled. we downloaded the dataset from Stanford’s relevant directory `tf.keras.utils.get_file`. After getting the data we created 2 pandas dataset (train and test) from text_dataset_from_directory of tensorflow library. We had to convert the 2 pandas dataframe into objects that are suitable objects for the BERT model. We achieve this convertions using 2 functions `convert_data_to_examples()` and `convert_examples_to_tf_dataset()`. The first one converts every row of pandas dataframe into an InputExample object. The other one creates the required input format with the tokenized InputExample objects and then create an input dataset that we can feed to the model. We used a stochastic gradient descent method from tensorflow (https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/optimizers/Adam), using CategoricalCrossentropy as our loss function, and SparseCategoricalAccuracy. After this we retrieved the reviews, we tokenized them, and than we gave to the pretrained model and we run a final softmax layer to get the predictions, using the argmax to get if a review is positive or negative. We wrote the result as a dict {anime_id:(number of positive,number of negative)} and we saved it in the `review_sentiment_dict.txt`."

Your goal is to provide to the personal trainer a schedule that maximizes the total length of the accepted appointments. For example, in the previous instance, the optimal solution is `[40, 50, 20]`, of total duration *110*.\n",

    "We start by making some remarks about the optimal solution. Let's suppose that, in a given day, the personal trainer receives $n$ requests $[r_1,r_2,\\dots,r_n]$, and let's define $S = [s_1, \\dots, s_k]$ as the (ordered) subset of appointments that will form our optimal solution for our problem in the given day.\n",
    "* An important observation is that, by definition, if $r_i$ is in the optimal solution, then neither $r_{i-1}$ nor $r_{i+1}$ belong to this solution. This is expression of the fact that we do not want to accept two consecutive appointments.\n",
    "* Another crucial observation that we want to make is that, given any couple of consecutive elements $r_i, r_j$ that are in the optimal solution, their distance is no more than $3$, i. e. $j-i\\leq 3$. I other words, given any three consecutive appointments of durations $r_i, r_{i+1}, r_{i+2}$, at least one of them is in the optimal solution. This fact is, in some sense, pretty intuitive, and it comes from the fact that our optimal solution is the longest possible, i.e. the one for which the quantity $\\sum s_j$ is maximized. The proof of this fact is trivial and we will just illustrate it with an example. Suppose that the followings are five consecutive appointments requested today: $[r_1,r_2,r_3,r_4,r_5]$ and assume that, among them, just $r_1,r_5$ are in the optimal solution; then, by adding $r_3$ to the solution we find another valid solution, which is longer than the optimal one, which is absurd.\n",

The algorithm will scan through each appointment, starting from the first, and will find the best possible solution (up to that point) that contains that appointment by confronting the best possible solution for the two preceeding appointment (not counting the adjacent one) and adding the appointment in question to that.
